<strong>Gun control</strong> protestors think the ownership for guns represents the meaning of liberty, however, when the freedom adversely influences other lives, I deeply doubt this freedom and we should take the gun control serious. 
I hope to get more insights by collecting and analyzing the gun-related data to assess the balance between liberty and precious lives.

### Insights:

	

	 *	Firearm-related death has increased in the past five years.
	 *	In the six intents of deaths, the firearm nearly always ranks at the top of the mechanisms leading to the deaths.
	 *	The large central metro is the accident-prone land, which might be one of the targets with more stringent gun control policies.
	 *	Death rate and death toll caused by firearms were rapidly rising.
	 *	In the past decades, the will of gun control is falling down in most regions.
