<strong>Gun control</strong> protestors think the ownership for guns represents the meaning of liberty, however, when the freedom adversely influences other lives, I deeply doubt this freedom and we should take the gun control serious. 
I hope to get more insights by collecting and analyzing the gun-related data to assess the balance between liberty and precious lives.
